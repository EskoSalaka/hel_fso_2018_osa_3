This is my submission for the #Round 3# of the Helsinki University course Full Stack Open.

This round was a bit confusing. I'm almost certain I got all the parts working, but there could be some smaller things I missed. 

It is slightly different from the example: the BUILD of the frontend is located under 'working_frontend' which also contains the frontend code, but it shouldnt be a problem since it can be also linked from there.

The deployed production-version of this application, which uses it's own production mongodb, can be found in https://damp-temple-68071.herokuapp.com/. The mongo.js script is used to populate development database, which has to be specified in the .env file.
